        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; padding: 20px; font-size: 20px;text-align: justify;">The School of
          Open Learning [a part of the Campus of Open Learning] formerly
          known as The School of Correspondence Courses and Continuing Education, established under the University of
          Delhi in 1962, is a pioneer Institution in the field of Distance Education in India.

          The country witnessed the beginning of an alternate mode of education when the School started with a modest
          admission of 900 students in 1962.
          The School enrolled more than two lakhs students in the Academic Session 2006-2007. On many occasions our
          students have been toppers in various disciplines.
          The admission process for various courses in the School is governed by the norms established by the
          University of Delhi.
          The examination is also conducted by the University of Delhi. The University of Delhi confers the degree to
          the students of the School as it
          does in the case of its other constituent colleges. There is no differentiation in the course curriculum
          followed by the School of Open Learning and
          other constituent colleges and Departments of the University of Delhi.
          In an effort to reach out to a larger number of students the school is in the process of opening up Study
          Center in the Eastern and the Western part of the National Capital Region of Delhi.


          The School offers Undergraduate/ Postgraduate Degree courses in the subjects of Arts/Humanities and
          Commerce. The medium of instruction is primarily through well- prepared printed course material which is
          distributed by mail to all the enrolled students. This is also supplemented through Personal Contact Program
          conducted for the benefit of students at various study centers run by the School. An experienced faculty is
          always available at the main campus for academic interaction with students.

          The School offers learning through the distance education mode which is a viable alternative for students
          who need a flexible medium of instruction to attain higher education and vocational skills.
